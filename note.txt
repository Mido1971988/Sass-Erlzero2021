* Sass:
    - stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
    - Sass is an extension to CSS
    - Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, 
    mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.

* to compile sass file ( main.scss ) to css file ( main.css ) will use live sass compiler extension 
    or use apps like koala or prepros .

* Import : 
    to compile css from different sass files (_global-rules.scss and _contact.scss) to one css file ( main.css) : 
        [1] add _ at the beginning of name of file ( _ means ignore this file and not compile it as a seperate css file)
        [2] @use "./path of file" 


* variables : 
    - difference between css variables and sass variables : 
    [1] css variables : written in :root{--main-color:red}
        and you can access it by writing var(--main-color)
        but in compiled file (main.css) will be shown as var(--main-color) not the accual color
    [2] sass variables : written like $alt-color:green
        and you can access it directly by writing the name $alt-color
        and have global or local scope ( check main.scss)
        and in compiled file will be shown as accual color not $alt-color

    - you can import variable from another file but you have two options to do this : 
    [1] @use "./sass/variables/colors" as *; then use name of variable (like in sidebar{color:$alt})
    [2] @use "./sass/variables/colors"; then use colors.name of variable ( like sidebar{color:colors.$alt})

* Nesting (check it on main.scss file)

* Property Declarations And Placeholder (check it on main.scss file)

* if & else (check it on main.scss file)

* Interpolation (check it on main.scss file)

* Comments (check it on main.scss file)

* Mixin And Include :
    - like extend but in mixin you can add parameter so will be dynamic like in (@include circle(100px);)

* For - Loop 
    - Difference between : 
        @for $i from 1 through 10
        And
        @for $i from 1 to 10

    - through number 10 is included in loop but to number 10 not included in loop 

* Each (check it on main.scss file)

* While Loop (check it on main.scss file)

* Create Grid System (check it on main.scss file)
